**A low-bandwidth, multilingual, voice-first system that helps underserved communities understand medical information and navigate public healthcare schemes.**

> AccessAI is not a diagnostic system. It is an information and navigation layer.

## The Problem

Millions of people in rural and semi-urban settings receive medical reports they cannot understand, in a healthcare landscape that is hard to navigate without help.

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Unexplained medical terms** | Reports use clinical shorthand (e.g., Hb 8.2, MCV low) with no plain-language context |
| **Lost-in-translation** | Existing translation tools convert words, not meaning |
| **Limited doctor access** | Consultations carry long wait times and out-of-pocket costs |
| **Fragmented policy information** | Government healthcare schemes are buried across large, poorly structured PDF portals |

The result: patients delay treatment not because care is unavailable, but because they cannot understand what they need or where to go.

---

## What AccessAI Does

AccessAI sits between the patient and the healthcare system. It takes a medical report, and returns a simple, voice-based explanation in Hindi — along with matched government schemes and clear next steps.

```
User uploads medical report (PDF / image)
        ↓
OCR extracts text (Amazon Textract)
        ↓
PII is stripped before AI processing (Comprehend + regex)
        ↓
S3 document auto-deleted (healthcare privacy)
        ↓
AI extracts, interprets, and simplifies medical content (Bedrock)
        ↓
Critical values detected → emergency alerts
        ↓
Relevant government schemes matched (RAG + Titan Embeddings)
        ↓
Hindi audio explanation delivered (Translate + Polly)
```

### Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Voice-first** | Designed for low-literacy and accessibility-constrained users |
| **Low-bandwidth** | Optimized for unstable or limited connectivity (PWA-ready) |
| **Privacy-aware** | PII anonymized before LLM; documents auto-deleted from S3 after OCR |
| **Non-diagnostic** | Every output carries an explicit medical disclaimer |
| **India-contextual** | Supports Hindi and English; matches national & state healthcare schemes |

---

## User Journey

**Step 1 — Upload**
The user selects their preferred language (English / Hindi / Kannada), then uploads a medical report (PDF, JPG, or PNG, up to 10 MB).

**Step 2 — Processing**
The system uploads to S3, extracts text via Textract, auto-deletes the S3 file for privacy, anonymizes PII (names, phone numbers, hospital IDs), and passes sanitized text to the AI layer.

**Step 3 — Analysis**
The AI generates a plain-language summary with key findings, abnormal values, things to note, and questions to ask your doctor. Each finding is source-grounded (citing where in the report the value was found). Critical values trigger emergency alerts with helpline numbers.

**Step 4 — Audio**
The summary is translated to Hindi via Amazon Translate (with Bedrock LLM fallback) and read aloud using Amazon Polly's neural voice (Kajal).

**Step 5 — Schemes**
The user enters basic profile info (state, income, age, BPL status) and the RAG engine matches eligible government health schemes with transparent match factors explaining *why* each scheme applies.

**Step 6 — Follow-up**
A chat interface lets the user ask follow-up questions about their report. Responses respect the same safety guardrails.

## Key Features

### Medical Document Understanding
- Supports PDFs and images (JPG, PNG, TIFF)
- Async Textract for multi-page PDFs; sync for single images
- Handles low-quality scans with quality scoring and fallback OCR

### Transparent AI Confidence Scoring
- Weighted 4-signal formula (not arbitrary): OCR readability (30%), extraction completeness (25%), abnormal-value certainty (25%), LLM self-evaluation (20%)
- Full breakdown visible in the UI so users and reviewers can audit the score

### Source-Grounded Findings
- Each key finding cites *where* in the report the value was extracted (e.g., "CBC table row 3")
- Local pattern-matching cross-checks LLM output against known medical reference ranges

### Medical Safety Guardrails
- Every summary prefixed with an explicit AI-generated disclaimer
- Uncertainty-aware phrasing: "This may indicate…", "Your doctor can help clarify…"
- Never diagnoses or recommends treatment
- Static safety banner rendered in the UI

### Critical Value Emergency Alerts
- Detects life-threatening lab values (e.g., glucose < 50, potassium > 6.0)
- Shows prominent alert banner with emergency helpline numbers
- One-tap call buttons for 112, 108 (ambulance), AIIMS

### Voice-First Audio
- Hindi audio via Amazon Translate → Amazon Polly (Kajal, neural engine)
- Full playback controls: play/pause, skip ±10s, speed (0.75x–2x), replay
- Compressed MP3 delivery via S3 presigned URLs (1-hour expiry)

### Government Scheme Matching (RAG)
- 15+ national and state schemes in knowledge base
- Retrieval via Titan Embeddings cosine similarity + hard eligibility filters
- Transparent match factors: checklist of ✓/✗ showing State, BPL, Income, Age, Conditions
- LLM-generated personalised recommendations explaining *why* each scheme is relevant

### Privacy-First Pipeline
- PII anonymized before any text reaches the LLM (regex + Comprehend)
- Documents auto-deleted from S3 immediately after OCR completes
- Session-based in-memory storage; no persistent database
- De-anonymization only at the response layer (user-facing)

### Follow-up Chat
- Conversational Q&A about the uploaded report
- Same safety guardrails and language support as the main analysis
- Chat history stored in session

### SMS Summary
- Send analysis summary + scheme info to any Indian mobile number (+91)
- Powered by Amazon SNS (optional; disabled by default)

| **Non-diagnostic** | Uncertainty-aware language; never diagnoses or prescribes |
| **Transport Security** | HTTPS in production; CORS restricted to known origins |

---

## Scope & Limitations

- AccessAI is a guidance and navigation tool, not a clinical system
- It does not diagnose conditions or prescribe treatment
- OCR errors are possible on low-quality scans; outputs include quality warnings
- Kannada text analysis is supported but Kannada audio is not (AWS Polly limitation)
- Scheme eligibility is indicative and should be verified with the relevant authority

---

## Why AccessAI

AccessAI addresses the first barrier to healthcare access: **understanding**.

Most digital health tools are built for the already-connected — people with smartphones, literacy, and time. AccessAI is built for everyone else. By converting medical and policy information into clear, localized, voice-based guidance, it gives underserved communities the clarity they need to take the right action, faster.
